v0.4 Dual Boards (Blue LB + Yellow CB), moved up to Teensy 3.2, removed IO Expanders, added more expansion/hacking headers.

v0.3.1 Hand re-worked v0.3 with 5V0 and 3V3 regulators each seperately sourced after power switch to provide improved power supplies.

v0.3 Dual Boards (both Red) with Teensy LC. One core board, one logic board. Used IO Expanders to drive the Core matrix, which ended up being way too slow.

v0.2 Bug fixes learned from v0.1 applied. This version has not been made or tested, but should work.

v0.1.1 Single Green Board worked after I added missing OR gate circuitry!
