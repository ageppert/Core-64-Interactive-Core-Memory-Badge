I received 5 completely assembled PCBs. 2 of 5 failed.

WORKS: 2K OK
WORKS: 2L OK
WORKS: 2M OK
FIXED: 2N D24 out. Replaced from batch 1 LEDs

FIXED: 2O Flakey D13, 15. Dead 23, 33, 38, 44, 48, bottom two rows.
Replaced 13. That fixed flakey 15 as well.
Reflowed 48, 49 to see if 50 and beyond would work. That did not help.
Replaced 23,33,38,44,48. That fixed all but 3 in the bottom two rows.
Replaced 49, 60, 62. Now it all works.

330°F with the 3/8 round nozzle was just hot enough to get the job done, but not yellow the boards.
Even 5° more would yellow them.

A hot plate at 300°F would have been ideal.

Conclusion is that the LEDs are a bad batch. I don't want to use those any more!
